# what is this about?
**With YourGamesSuc I want to help indie devs (including myself) make the risks of game production calculated.** The general workflow of the final solution is: (1) you input info about your game (2) you get the probability the game with given parameters gets this much revenue, that much players, and so on + the breakdown of how every parameter influenced the verdict.

# structure
The project consists of four main modules:

**COLLECTOR**: updates game data

**CATEGORIZER**: derives the gameplay, theme, and visual categories from Steam user tags, Steam genres, and IGDB keywords

**TRAINER**: trains classification models

**PREDICTOR**: predicts and visualizes success

# data
Data sources include:
- Steam
- IGDB
- SteamSpy
- SteamPlayerCount
- SteamPriceHistory

# methodology
## collector
*to be filled*

## categorizer

## trainer

## predictor

# note
This is a work in progress. I have finished the research and MVP and now working on streamlining everything.
